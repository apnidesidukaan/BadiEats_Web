## 🌐 Why Micro Frontends?

Micro Frontends decompose a monolithic frontend into **independent, modular applications**. This approach benefits **BadiEats** by offering:

- **Scalability**: Add or update features without disrupting other modules.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Load and deliver business-specific features on demand.
- **Independent Deployment**: Teams can develop and deploy modules separately.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Parallel development of features by different teams.
- **Custom User Experience**: Each user role sees only relevant modules (e.g., Restaurant Admin, Delivery Partner, Customer).

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Business Registration**: Restaurants register on the platform and access relevant modules.
2. **Dynamic Module Loading**: Tailored micro frontends are loaded based on user roles.
3. **Order Management**: Customers place orders, and restaurants and delivery partners handle fulfillment.
